# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Web App

This is a Streamlit-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes using five machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Users can input health parameters and get instant prediction results from each model.

## 🚀 Features

## 🧠 Model Training
The models are trained on the popular Healthcare Diabetes dataset. Each model is trained, evaluated, and used for real-time prediction in the app.
